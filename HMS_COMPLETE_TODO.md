## Implementation Order
1. Fix database and verify all tables
2. Fix backend API endpoints
3. Implement frontend functionality module by module
4. Set up external access
5. Test everything end-to-end
6. Document and deploy

## Current Status
- [x] Backend running on port 5500 - Fixed with correct database
- [x] Frontend served on port 5501 - Working
- [x] Database connected to Neon - Updated to correct project DB
- [x] WebSocket server running
- [x] External URLs exposed:
  - Backend: https://hms-backend-api-morphvm-mkofwuzh.http.cloud.morph.so
  - Frontend: https://hospital-management-morphvm-mkofwuzh.http.cloud.morph.so

## Issues Fixed
- [x] Updated database connection to correct project (crimson-star-18937963)
- [x] Fixed User table authentication with proper case and enum values
- [x] Created comprehensive backend with all endpoints
- [x] Created fully functional frontend with all modules
- [x] Exposed services externally:
  - Backend: https://hms-backend-complete-morphvm-mkofwuzh.http.cloud.morph.so (Port 5600)
  - Frontend: Currently on port 5501

## Current Working Status
